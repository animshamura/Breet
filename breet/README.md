# CAR RENTALS APP

In this project, I developed a frontend web application, Car Rentals using [Car Rentals API](https://car-rental-rails.herokuapp.com/) - [Repo](https://github.com/tGodson/car-rental-rails) 

The application features includes:
- A proper Authentication for Sign in and Sign up

- Listing of Cars for Hire
- User can add car to favourites
- User can access list of cars added as favourites
